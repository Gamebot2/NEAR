                    NEAR Protocol ("NEAR" hereafter) is a decentralized development platform where developers can host
                    serverless applications and smart contracts that easily connect to "open finance" [1] networks and
                    benefit from an ecosystem of "open web" [2] components. Unlike most blockchain-based platforms, NEAR
                    Protocol is built from the ground up to be the easiest in the world for developers and their end
                    users, while still providing the scalability and security you need to serve those users.
                    Specifically, NEAR is designed to make it easier to:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Build decentralized applications, even if you're only used to building with "traditional" web or
                        app concepts.</li>
                    <li>Onboard users with a smooth experience, even if they have never used crypto, tokens, keys,
                        wallets, or other blockchain artifacts.</li>
                    <li>Scale your application seamlessly - the underlying platform automatically expands capacity via
                        sharding without additional costs or effort on your part.</li>
                </ol>

                <p class="question">What is a blockchain?​</p>
                <p class="answer">A blockchain is a particular type of irreversible distributed ledger which combines
                    aspects of both computation and data storage. Each new block which is added contains modifications
                    to the state of the ledger that have been agreed upon by the consensus of the distributed nodes
                    which run the network.
                    These ledgers allow for a large number of participants to permissionlessly but collaboratively
                    manage extremely large amounts of value (Bitcoin is worth >$100B) entirely through basic
                    cryptoeconomic incentives.
                    While it is intellectually interesting to explore the theory and technology behind blockchains, it
                    is not necessary to do this in order to build, test, and deploy apps. Similarly, you don't need to
                    understand how fault-tolerant commodity compute clusters work inside AWS, GCP, or Azure in order to
                    deploy an app to these clouds. Focus on the code! We've made it easy.
                </p>

                <p class="question">Who can attend?</p>
                <p class="answer">This event is open to everybody within the community, there are no restrictions. All
                    levels of experience are welcome. We will have a workshop to help you understand the NEAR ecosystem,
                    NEAR protocol and blockchains in general.</p>

                <p class="question">What should I bring?</p>
                <p class="answer">Yourself, and any form of picture ID proving you are over 18 years old, a laptop,
                    chargers, or anything else you might need within the hackathon time. Firearms, weapons, alcohol,
                    illegal drugs, and power tools are not allowed. </p>

                <p class="question">Are there any rules?</p>
                <p class="answer">You cannot demo somebody else’s work, i.e., everything you demo must be done by your
                    team. All attendees (hackers, supporters, mentors, volunteers, etc.) must abide by the MLH Code of
                    Conduct.</p>

                <p class="question">How do teams work?</p>
                <p class="answer">Teams are typically of 4-5 members each. We do not allow individuals or teams smaller 
                    than 4 people. To create a team, please fill out the registration form with all of your team members'
                    names. If you would like to change teams or add a team member, please contact us at [EMAIL ADDRESS].

                <p class="question">How do projects Work?</p>
                <p class="answer">You can select one of our recommended projects on the site (any number of teams can
                    work on a project) or pick one of your own. You can start on the project anytime, right after the
                    team is formed. You do not have to wait until the event to get started. You must, however, finish it
                    before the final presentations at the event.</p>

                <p class="question">How much money will this cost me?</p>
                <p class="answer">The event is free for all qualified participants.</p>
                <p class="question">What do I wear?</p>
                <p class="answer">Wear whatever you are most comfortable in! No need to wear anything professional.
                    However, we do require you to be within the MLH Code of Conduct.</p>
